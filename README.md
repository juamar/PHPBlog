# PHPBlog

Simple CRUD PHP web application showing Blog and some post made 2 years ago. Using sqllite3 and PDO.

Sorry, the UI is in spanish, but the options are quite intuitive. Will be nice to have some details view. No authentication in this project.

In db folder there is an adminer and a PHPInfo to test the server and the database. Be sure to have read and write permisions in blog.db file.
